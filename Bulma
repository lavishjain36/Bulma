Bulma is a free, open-source CSS framework that is designed to make it easy to create responsive and visually appealing websites. It was created by Jeremy Thomas in 2016 and is based on the concept of Flexbox, a layout method that allows elements to be positioned and aligned in flexible ways, making it easy to create responsive designs.

One of the key features of Bulma is that it provides a set of CSS classes that can be applied to HTML elements to create a consistent layout and design across different screen sizes. These classes can be used to create common layout elements such as grids, columns, and navigation menus, as well as more specific elements like forms, buttons, and modals.

Bulma also provides a set of variables that can be used to customize the look and feel of your website. These variables can be used to change things like font sizes, colors, and spacing, and can be easily overridden in your own CSS styles.

To use Bulma in your website, you can simply include the CSS file in the head of your HTML document, and then apply the classes to your HTML elements as needed. You can also download the source files from the Bulma website, and customize the CSS and variables according to your need.

One of the main advantage of using Bulma is that it is lightweight and easy to use, making it a good option for both beginners and experienced developers. Another advantage is that it is based on Flexbox, which is a powerful layout method that makes it easy to create responsive designs.

Overall, Bulma is a great CSS framework that can help you create visually appealing and responsive websites quickly and easily. It is a good choice for anyone looking to build a website without having to start from scratch, and it offers a lot of flexibility and customization options.


Some important concepts to understand when using Bulma include:

Flexbox: Bulma is based on Flexbox, which is a layout system that allows elements within a container to be aligned and distributed in a flexible and responsive manner. This is what allows Bulma to create responsive and flexible layouts for various screen sizes.

Grid system: Bulma uses a 12-column grid system that allows developers to create complex and responsive layouts for their websites. The grid system is based on Flexbox and is easily customizable.

Classes: Bulma uses a set of predefined classes that can be applied to HTML elements to create different types of UI components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation.

Variables: Bulma allows developers to customize the look and feel of their website by using a set of predefined variables, such as colors, fonts, and spacing. These variables can be easily modified to match the design of your website.

Modifiers: Bulma provides a set of modifiers that can be added to classes to create variations of UI components, such as different sizes and colors.

SASS: Bulma uses SASS, a CSS pre-processor, which allows developers to write more efficient and organized CSS code. It is optional to use but is recommended to make more complex styles.

Responsive Design: Bulma is built with a mobile-first approach and therefore it is responsive by default. It adjusts the layout of elements according to the screen size.
